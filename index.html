<h2>07/02/2019</h2>
	<p>Learning how to use git. Everything before this date is version 5 of the website. This is v5.1. I hope v6 will be a full featured and developed website. </p>	

<h2>26/01/2019</h2>
	<p>Job is going well. Created a new logo image for the top of the site and for other projects. Created using GIMP</p>	

<h2>07/03/2018</h2>
	<p>Got a job.</p>

<h2>09/01/2018</h2>
	<p>New year. Over the holiday break I did some star and moon observing for college, and myself. It was fun. The skies in Kerry are excellent <i>seeing</i>, which I recently learned is the word used to describe the atmosphere's effect on night sky objects. I also bought a book titled 'Collins Star & Planets 5th Edition' and it is practically useful. It has some general tips of binoculars and telescopes, constellations, galaxies, and planets. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in Astronomy.</p>

<h2>12/09/2017</h2>
	<p>I have finished my Solar System Basic project, feel free to download from the download section or from <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8JftXx-K-A6bkZsNmg2aDFaTGs/view>here</a>. </p>

<h2>05/09/2017</h2>
	<p>I've been doing a little bit of science lately and have made a basic model Solar System using Unity. It's still work in progress so this list isn't complete but credit goes to Brackeys (<a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys>Youtube</a>) for giving me the idea, HiggyB (<a href=https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-able-to-manage-full-scale-stellar-systems.38782/>Link</a>) from the Unity forums for being a pioneer in this sort of thing. Head over to the downloads page to try it out.</p>
		
	<p>It's been a while since I've done any real work on this site, which isn't great. Perhaps an overhaul will happen eventually but for now I'm excited to be working on other IT stuff such as the above project.</p>

<h2>04/03/2017</h2>
	<p>The job workshop went well. Will see where that goes. I've been thinking about the deteriorating quality of website writing. No longer am I doing a step by step explanation of what I have learnt. This is bad and I apologise. In the future, I will try and actually explain what I have done or am trying to do. Consider this the first of that. I have found an awesome guide to shader programming: <a href=https://goo.gl/GjExAv>https://goo.gl/GjExAv</a> and <a href=https://www.shadertoy.com/new>https://www.shadertoy.com/new</a></p>

<h2>14/02/2017</h2>
	<p>It has been a long time. A very stressful couple of weeks for me. But today I will be at a workshop which will hopefully get me an internship or maybe even a job! Very excited.</p>

<h2>31/01/2017</h2>
	<p>It is the end of the beginning of the year! I have learned a little bit of C# programming outside of Unity. A few completed programs are available to download. There is an idea floating around inside my head for a program to help my mum on her computer. It would be using what I have learned already so it shouldn't be too difficult. In Unity news, I have started a new Unity created tutorial project which will require some time to complete I suspect, as it seems a little more advanced than the others. But my friends have linked to me a Unity course online which will be done after this current project. If anyone is trying to hack this site.. be warned!</p>

<h2>21/01/2017</h2>
	<p>Finally finished all of the HL2 achievements. What a pain in the neck!</p>
	<img src="images/hl2 achievements.PNG" alt="HL2" style="width:60%;height:80%">

<h2>16/01/2017</h2>
	<p>Learning how to add more pages to the site now. Will add a download page with links to my Unity video game projects as they are completed!</p>
	<h4>Addendum</h4>
	<p>So the download section is working, but still under construction. Today was a productive day. Completed the Roguelike video game project from Unity, then uploaded it to the site. Followed by the creation of a second page for the website for the previously mentioned game. Altogether, it was several hours of work today but it has paid off.</p>
	
<h2>10/01/2017</h2>
	<p>So the website was updated, and is looking quite good. Not gonna stop there but for now it's functional and the HTML is cleaner. I've been making some games in Unity. The tutorials are my guide so I cannot claim any original work. But it feels rewarding to make a video game. I have signed up with the Open University to read Astrophysics so will see how this goes.</p>

<h2>28/12/2016</h2>
	<p>Just a quick update to the website's code today. May not be live on this date because of an internet outage so will upload as soon as I can. Improvements were made to the HTML to allow easier comprehension and additions. I will upload the old version to the future download page. Visually, the website looks a lot smarter. The main blog is scrollable with an invisible scrollbar (on chrome at least). The social media links are bigger and always displayed. The right hand navigation bar is currently empty but has a lot of space for future additions. The pictures in the blog text no longer have a black bar around them. Most importantly, the style of the site has not changed much, since I quite like it atm.</p>

<h2>26/12/2016</h2>
	<p>Merry Christmas! The website building project has been placed on the back burnder for a while. In technical terms, the website has not changed at all since the last update. For the time being, that won't change. However, there are plans for the future. First, I'm going to remake the website in the backend. Visually, it might not change much. But my intention is to re-write every line more effeciently. </p>
	<p>I want to add some features to the site. First, a navigation bar at the top to link to other pages in the site. A download page where visitors can download stuff I want to share would be nice. Second, a cleaner homepage with a static background and scrolling foreground to allow me to have social media links on the side of the text.</p>

	<h4>Unity</h4>
	<p>One of the reasons that the site has not been updated for long is because most of my effort has been on learning Unity. Succesfully made a small 3d game (something I'd like to make available on the download page) following their learning assignments which has been a confidence booster. Now, it seems like I want to take it further and spend all of my time with this software and release my own video game as a product. I have written down some ideas but first the technical knowledge must be learned. Look for updates in the new year! </p> 

<h2>05/12/2016</h2>
	<p>Made some additions to the site, some good and some bad. The page now has a footer with links to social media. The images aren't perfect (hand made like everything). They will do for now until I can make something better. Don't let their inconsistent text alignment trigger your OCD. In addition to that, I have also added a scroll bar to the main blog body. I'm not sure if I like it. It certainly makes it easier to see the heading and footer without having to scroll through the entire page, but it feels wrong somehow. I consider it a temporary addition until something better is found.</p>

<h2>02/12/2016</h2>
	<p>Opened up unity for the second time and created a new project. The first time I opened it was to mess around with the example project included. After about a minute it became apparent that this software will be harder to use than HTML. So will shut it down for now and refer to some guides, and then maybe play around with the example project again. In other news, I am pleased with the progress of the website since yesterday. Although it isn't an advanced website, it can present text and images to people reading so it functions as a good blog website for now. I will try and make incremental improvements as I go along but do not expect any major changes for now. Because I do not know better, I will have to manually resize images as I go to fit nicely in the page. It would look better if images were more embedded into the page, because right now it looks like they are floating and distracting. Using div elements allows me to create borders around images to separate them from the text for clarity, as well as instruct the image to fill up the div space to 100%, and then to resize I just have to change the div without touching the image again. </p>

<h2> 01/12/2016 </h2>
	<p>HTML picture test is my objective at time of writing. If you see this on the live website without a picture, it means I have gone wrong.</p>
	<p>I have found a good website for learning HTML: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a>. So I will be following that for the current task and probably again in the future. It seems like a more thorough resource than wikihow..</p>
	<img src="images/01122016-1.jpg" alt="Picture of a screen, 01/12/2016" style="width:80%;height:45%">
	<p>Just before I upload this, I noticed that the filesize of the picture is massive (bigger than it needs to be) so that will need to be reuploaded at a smaller file size. Other thoughts: try and keep a consistent style with the website. A basic looking website can look good if its presented clearly to the reader. Also, it would be good to make the page look better on a 1920x1080 monitor, since currently it looks better on mobile because of word wrapping.</p> 
	<h4>01/12/2016 Addendum</h4>
	<p>The picture is upside down. Caused by samsung data embedded in the file. This means that learning how to rotate images through HTML could be a good task. Otherwise, will maybe have to edit them before upload. Next, I want to make pages for the site so infinite scrolling isn't required. Also have just found a stack overflow thread on how to limit width of the page so will test this out with this version. Investigating div elements as well, since that would allow me to make the page pretty. Check out that blue heading at the top, that's a div block. Accomplished aligning the entire page to the centre. Added a blue border around the blog content, and trying to add a background image as well.</p>
	<h4>01/12/2016 Addendum</h4>
	<p>Succesfully added a background image, and the side by side image below shows the changes that have been made to the websites visual look since this morning. Unfortunately, pictures are broken on mobile now since they are wider than the text. Will attempt to fix right now. Overall though the site looks a little better.</p>
	<img src="images/01122016-2.png" alt="before and after comparison" style="width:80%;height:45%">
	<h4>01/12/2016 Addendum</h4>
	<p>The mobile version of images no longer extends beyond the text like earlier, but they still look bad. The images are currently being displayed at a given percentage of the "blog body" if that expression makes sense? So it looks decent enough on desktop but they are very warped on mobile. If there is a better way to get consistent images accross all platforms I will find it.</p> 

<h2> 30/11/2016 </h2>
	<p> Today I have learned the basics of HTML from wikihow.com. Once this is uploaded, I shall use this basic HTML page as a blog to note my efforts to learn Unity and other related projects. I also want to learn how to do computer programming. -A</p>
