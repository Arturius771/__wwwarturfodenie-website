			<h1>I make websites.</h1>
			<p>Most people use computers to access content that is made available via the internet. Having a presence online is a benefit to individuals, businesses, and organisations. When you have a visitor on your website, you are interacting with them. That interaction should be interesting, useful, and beneficial to everyone. Having a website is not the only requirement these days, that website must also be thoughtful and modern. With the right person designing your website, you can easily achieve this.</p>
